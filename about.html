        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Andrew Oh</p>
        <p>I am currently a senior at Michigan State University studying to become a 3d artist with experience in multiple graphic design, 3d modeling and video editing programs which includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blender</li>
            <li>Adobe CC</li>
            <li>Maya 2020</li>
            <li>Unreal Engine</li>
            <li>Cascadeur</li>
            <li>Zbrush</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I've spent countless hours in these various applications and enjoy challenging myself with intricate projects that encompass architectural design, character modeling, and product visualization. My enjoyment of 3D modeling has been a driving force in my life, and I'm determined to turn my passion into a full-fledged career. Many of my interests have also lead me to explore audio production and video editing which I have made into a side hustle selling custom made sounds for music producers and video editors.</p>
